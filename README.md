# BoldChess-Stockfish-Web-GUI : Web GUI For Stockfish Chess


## Overview

BoldChess-Stockfish-Web-GUI is a web graphical user interface (GUI) that loads the JS compiled version of the Stockfish chess engine. It is a fully functional web app that allows you to play against the Stockfish chess engine.


## Mission

There are a lot of desktop-based chess GUIs but very few when it comes to web-based chess GUIs. Most chess websites develop their own web chess GUIs and never release the source codes with the exception of (lichess.org).

Most available web-based chess GUIs online that are FOSS (free and open source) use outdated libraries, scripts, and chess engines.

Our mission from this non-profit side project is to develop a FOSS (100% Free & Open Source) web-based Chess GUI that can be used everywhere. Modern, clean, responsive, free, and open to all.

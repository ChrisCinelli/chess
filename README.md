## Overview

BoldChess-Stockfish-Web-GUI is a web graphical user interface (GUI) that loads the JS compiled version of the Stockfish chess engine. It is a fully functional web app that allows you to play against the Stockfish chess engine.


## Mission

There are a lot of desktop-based chess GUIs but very few when it comes to web-based chess GUIs. Most chess websites develop their own web chess GUIs and never release the source codes with the exception of (lichess.org).

Our mission from this project is to develop a modern responsive free and open source web-based chess GUI.
